# Algorithm Exercises

Repository to save all the algorithms that I solved to practice algorithms, but also all the others that I was not able to complete during my time window for this.

## Algorithm Lessons learned

- [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm) to get the majority
- [Bit xor](https://hackernoon.com/xor-the-magical-bit-wise-operator-24d3012ed821) to cancel same numbers
- Most significant bit
- [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)

## Language lessons learned
- JavaScript sort is made for strings, for numbers is required to do a subtraction
- In Python avoid pop and try to access directly to the element, that improves performance a lot
- Python for-in does not include "end"
