# Algorithm Exercises

Repository to save all the algorithms that I solve to practice, but also, some
of these are incomplete.

## Lessons learned

- [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm) to get the majority
- [Bit xor](https://hackernoon.com/xor-the-magical-bit-wise-operator-24d3012ed821) to cancel same numbers
- Most significant bit
- [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
